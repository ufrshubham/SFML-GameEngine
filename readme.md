# SFML - Game Engine

## A simple SFML project to understand the architecture behind game engines

---

### Contains

- An assets manager to hold your sprites and fonts. Maybe I'll add support for audio assets too, maybe!!!.

- A state manager to hold various game states-> Like main menu state, pause state, game over state, wepon selection state, etc.

### How to use

- Basically you should only need AssetMan.hpp, StateMan.hpp and their corresponding .cpp files.

- I have create a simple snake game for reference. In there you can see how to use StateMan and AssetMan.

### Dependencies

- [SFML 2.5.1](https://www.sfml-dev.org/index.php)

[NOTE] : I have created this engine just for my understanding and it might not be the most effecient solution.
